# [gls.py](gls.py) - Generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram

gls.py is a standalone script for python2 and python3. It also runs from the command line.

Here is an example for a working plot:

<img src="demo_gls.png" width="50%"/>

### Usage from shell command line
Run the demo with
```bash
python gls.py
```

A shortcut `gls` is very convenient
```bash
ln gls.py ~/bin/gls
```
Then you can use it for instance as
```bash
gls your_data_file -fend 1.
```
